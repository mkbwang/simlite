# Parametric Simulation of Sequencing Count Data

`simlite` package is meant to simulate high throughput sequencing data tables (e.g. metagenomics sequencing, scRNAseq). It can

* accomodate multiple marginal distributions,  such as Poisson, Gamma, negative binomial and log normal. Zero inflation can be introduced as well.

* allow setting up dependence structures among features based on Gaussian copula.

* Fit marginal distributions to real data.
