\title{sum of log likelihoods for zero inflated negative binomial distribution}
\usage{
logzinb(param, x)

\arguments{
\item{param}{a named vector with three elements. The first one is the zero probability (logitpi0).
The other two are  the mean (logmu) and the size parameter (logsize) of negative binomial distribution.}
